## Introduction

Flooding, often resulting from heavy rains and typhoons, can lead to severe property damage and health hazards. Being equipped with a proper plan is essential for safety. Understanding local flood patterns and historical data can help you better prepare for such events.

## Before Flooding

- **Prepare an Evacuation Kit:** Stock up on necessities like water, food, and medical supplies. Consider including extra clothing, a battery-powered radio, and copies of important documents.
- **Know Your Evacuation Routes:** Check evacuation routes and safe high ground locations in advance, and share these plans with family members.
- **Protect Your Property:** Implement flood prevention measures like sandbags, waterproofing important areas, and securing loose outdoor items. It is also wise to discuss flood insurance options with your provider.

## During Flooding

- **Avoid Floodwaters:** Never enter flooded roads or areas; even a few inches of water can be dangerous.
- **Evacuate to Higher Ground:** Move quickly to safe elevated locations, following the routes designated by local authorities.
- **Stay Updated:** Monitor the latest information via radio, mobile phones, or local alert systems. Listen carefully to official instructions and do not delay evacuation.

## After Flooding

- **Inspect for Hazards:** Check for structural damage, gas leaks, and electrical hazards both inside and outside buildings. Avoid touching any standing water that may be contaminated.
- **Avoid Re-Entry:** Do not return to low-lying areas until safety is confirmed by local authorities.
- **Follow Official Instructions:** Comply with directions from emergency services regarding further evacuations or temporary sheltering, and report any immediate hazards.
