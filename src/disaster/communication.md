## Introduction

In times of disaster, ensuring effective communication with family and loved ones is crucial. Natural calamities can disrupt traditional communication channels, making it essential to be familiar with alternative methods to confirm safety and share information. This guide outlines various communication tools and strategies to employ during emergencies in Japan.

## Primary Communication Tools

- **Disaster Emergency Message Dial (171)**: Activated during significant disasters, this service allows individuals to record and retrieve voice messages. By dialing "171" and following the prompts, you can leave a 30-second message that can be accessed by others nationwide.

- **Disaster Message Boards**: Mobile carriers provide internet-based message boards where users can post and view safety information. These platforms are accessible via smartphones and computers, enabling text-based communication when voice calls are challenging.

- **Public Payphones**: In emergencies, public payphones are prioritized and often remain operational even when mobile networks are congested. Familiarize yourself with the locations of payphones in your area and carry small change to use them if needed.

## Alternative Communication Methods

- **Social Media Platforms**: Services like X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and LINE can be instrumental for sharing updates and checking on others. Ensure you have these apps installed and are connected with family and friends to facilitate quick communication. Many government agencies and emergency services provide real-time updates through these platforms.

- **Pre-Designated Contacts**: Establish a communication plan with family members, including a designated out-of-area contact person. Instruct all family members to check in with this person, who can then relay information, ensuring everyone stays informed even if direct communication is disrupted.

- **Leaving a Written Message (Communication Notes)**: If mobile networks and internet services are unavailable, leaving a handwritten message at an agreed location (such as a home entrance, workplace, or evacuation center bulletin board) can serve as an alternative means of communication. Write down essential information, such as your evacuation destination, condition, and any further instructions for family members or colleagues.

## Preparation and Practice

- **Regular Drills**: Familiarize yourself and your family with the use of the Disaster Emergency Message Dial and message boards. Participate in scheduled drills to ensure everyone knows how to use these services effectively.

- **Multiple Communication Channels**: Do not rely solely on one method of communication. Equip yourself with various tools and establish multiple ways to connect with loved ones during emergencies.

## Conclusion

Being prepared with multiple communication methods can significantly enhance your ability to stay connected during disasters. Regularly review and practice these strategies with your family to ensure everyone knows how to communicate effectively when it matters most.
