## During the Earthquake

- **Drop, Cover, and Hold On**: Immediately drop to your hands and knees to prevent being knocked over, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops.
- **Stay Indoors**: Do not run outside during the shaking as falling debris from buildings can cause serious injury.
- **Avoid Windows and Glass**: Move away from windows, mirrors, and other glass objects that might shatter.
- **Protect Your Head**: Shield your head and neck with your arms if you cannot take cover under a piece of furniture.

## Considerations for the Living Room

- **Watch for Hazards**: In the living room, be especially mindful of large windows, glass doors, and mounted electronics (like TVs) that can become dangerous if they fall.
- **Secure Cover**: If possible, take cover behind sturdy furniture or against an interior wall away from windows and heavy shelves.
- **Clear the Area**: Quickly assess the space for loose items that might become projectiles and move them if it is safe to do so.

## Considerations for the Bedroom

- **In-Bed Safety**: If you are in bed when the earthquake strikes, try to protect your head with a pillow. If safe, exit the bed to avoid being trapped by falling objects.
- **Furniture Awareness**: Check that heavy furniture (e.g., wardrobes or dressers) is secure. If you’re near such items, move to a safer part of the room.
- **Drop, Cover, and Hold On**: Even in a bedroom, follow the standard safety practice of dropping, covering, and holding on to protect yourself.

## After the Earthquake

- **Check for Injuries and Hazards**: Once the shaking stops, assess yourself and others for injuries. Be cautious of structural damages, gas leaks, and electrical hazards.
- **Be Prepared for Aftershocks**: Aftershocks are common following the main quake. Remain vigilant and be ready to drop, cover, and hold on again.
- **Follow Official Guidance**: Listen to local authorities and emergency broadcasts for evacuation orders or further instructions.

## Transportation Disruptions

- **Stay Informed**: If transportation systems are paralyzed, rely on local news and official updates to understand the situation.
- **Conserve Resources**: Conserve mobile phone battery and other communication resources to stay in touch with family and receive emergency alerts.
- **Plan Locally**: Avoid unnecessary travel and prepare to stay indoors or move only if absolutely necessary. Follow official evacuation routes and instructions if movement becomes required.
- **Alternative Arrangements**: Consider arranging local support or assistance, as emergency services may be stretched thin during transportation disruptions.

## Additional Safety Tips

- **Prepare an Emergency Kit**: Keep a kit with water, non-perishable food, medications, a flashlight, batteries, and a first aid kit.
- **Know Your Evacuation Routes**: Familiarize yourself with the safest exit routes from your home or workplace.
- **Stay Informed**: Monitor reliable sources for updates and instructions during and after an earthquake.
