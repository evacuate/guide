## Introduction

Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. Being prepared and knowing what to do during an earthquake can save lives and reduce injuries. This guide provides essential steps and tips for handling an earthquake safely in Japan.

## During the Earthquake

- **Drop, Cover, and Hold On**: Immediately drop to your hands and knees to prevent being knocked over, take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture, and hold on until the shaking stops.
- **Stay Indoors**: Do not run outside during the shaking as falling debris from buildings can cause serious injury.
- **Avoid Windows and Glass**: Move away from windows, mirrors, and other glass objects that might shatter.
- **Protect Your Head**: Shield your head and neck with your arms if you cannot take cover under a piece of furniture.

## After the Earthquake

- **Check for Injuries and Hazards**: Once the shaking stops, assess yourself and others for injuries. Be cautious of structural damages, gas leaks, and electrical hazards.
- **Be Prepared for Aftershocks**: Aftershocks are common following the main quake. Remain vigilant and be ready to drop, cover, and hold on again.
- **Follow Official Guidance**: Listen to local authorities and emergency broadcasts for evacuation orders or further instructions.

## Additional Safety Tips

- **Prepare an Emergency Kit**: Keep a kit with water, non-perishable food, medications, a flashlight, batteries, and a first aid kit.
- **Know Your Evacuation Routes**: Familiarize yourself with the safest exit routes from your home or workplace.
- **Stay Informed**: Monitor reliable sources for updates and instructions during and after an earthquake.
