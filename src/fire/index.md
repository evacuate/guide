## Introduction

Fires can spread rapidly and pose serious risks to life and property. A clear understanding of fire prevention and evacuation procedures is vital.

## Fire Prevention

- **Install Smoke Alarms:** Regularly inspect and test for proper operation.
- **Keep Exits Clear:** Always maintain clear emergency escape routes.
- **Avoid Electrical Overload:** Prevent overloading electrical outlets and circuits.

## During a Fire

- **Evacuate Immediately:** Move quickly to the nearest safe exit.
- **Stay Low:** Crawl to avoid smoke inhalation.
- **Close Doors:** Close room doors to help slow the spread of fire.

## Location-Specific Procedures

### In Hotels

- **Follow Hotel Staff Instructions:** Hotel personnel are trained in evacuation procedures; listen to their announcements and follow designated routes.
- **Do Not Use Elevators:** Always use stairs during an evacuation.
- **Locate Emergency Exits:** Familiarize yourself with emergency exit signs, which are usually clearly marked in corridors and near elevators.
- **Assist Others:** If you are staying with family or vulnerable individuals, help them evacuate safely and calmly.

### In Public Places

- **Follow Official Announcements:** In malls, theaters, or transportation hubs, public address systems and digital signage will provide evacuation directions.
- **Identify Multiple Exits:** Note the location of all available exits and avoid congested areas.
- **Stay Calm and Move Quickly:** Avoid panic; orderly movement helps prevent stampedes and injuries.
- **Help Vulnerable People:** Assist children, the elderly, or those with disabilities to evacuate safely.

## After a Fire

- **Do Not Re-Enter:** Wait for official clearance before returning to the building.
- **Seek Medical Attention:** Even minor injuries should be checked by a medical professional.
- **Report the Incident:** Contact the fire department and relevant authorities to report hazards or damage.
