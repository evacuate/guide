## Introduction

When a tsunami warning is issued, every second counts. This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions for evacuating safely during a tsunami emergency.

## Evacuation Preparation

Before a tsunami occurs, residents in coastal areas should:

- Identify designated evacuation zones and high-ground locations.
- Familiarize themselves with the fastest evacuation routes from home, work, and school.
- Establish a family meeting point well away from the coast.
- Participate in local tsunami drills to ensure readiness.

## During a Tsunami Warning

When an alert is announced, take the following immediate actions:

1. **Evacuate Without Delay:** Leave your current location immediately and proceed to the nearest safe area or high ground.
2. **Follow Official Instructions:** Listen to emergency broadcasts, public announcements, and follow clearly marked evacuation routes.
3. **Avoid Coastal Areas:** Do not attempt to return until local authorities have declared it safe.
4. **Assist Others:** Help vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly and children, to evacuate safely.

## Evacuation Tips

- If roads become congested or water levels rise rapidly, consider walking if it is the safest option.
- Keep a mobile phone charged and carry a portable battery charger if available.
- Stay calm and move in an orderly manner to avoid panic.
- Secure any loose items that might cause hazards during your evacuation.
- Stay updated with emergency alerts via battery-powered radio or mobile notifications.

## Post-Evacuation Guidance

After reaching a safe zone:

- Remain at your designated shelter or high ground until local officials confirm it is safe to return.
- Report your status to family or local authorities if possible.
- Stay alert for potential aftershocks or additional waves, as tsunamis may occur in multiple phases.
